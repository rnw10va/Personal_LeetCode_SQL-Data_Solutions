Problem Name: 180. Consecutive Numbers
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/
Problem Description:

Table: Logs
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.


Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.


Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

--My Solution
WITH NumsAndNullsCTE AS (
    SELECT
        CASE 
            WHEN num=LAG(num,1) OVER(ORDER BY ID) AND num=LAG(num,2) OVER(ORDER BY ID)
            THEN num
            ELSE NULL
            END AS ConsecutiveNums
    FROM Logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT ConsecutiveNums
FROM NumsAndNullsCTE
WHERE ConsecutiveNums IS NOT NULL
